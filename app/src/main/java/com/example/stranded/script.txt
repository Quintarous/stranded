There must be something here...

Something something something always looking for something.

Today it's bottles tomorrow it'll be something else, and whatever it is it'll be stupidly hard to find.

Because nothings ever easy...

Wait...

What are you I wonder?

It looks kinda like an ai cartridge back home... but like crappier.

I can't believe it! An actual live ai cartridge right here.

I've never seen one like this before though.

You must be an old model. Like really old.

Were you sitting here this whole time? How long have you been active?

                                                               I heard you talking to yourself. -> 1
                                                                What do you mean? I'm not an ai -> 2

1:
Heh heh yea...

I haven't come across anyone or anything to talk to since i've been here.

But you still didn't answer my question!

How long have you been active for?
