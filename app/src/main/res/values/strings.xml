    <string name="about_body">Stranded is a portfolio project meant to be a showcase of what I’m capable of as an android developer. Let me be upfront and say I am completely self taught. I started out knowing nothing and essentially just used google\'s android documentation and guides to learn kotlin, the android framework, how to do literally anything and everything, you get the gist. I did my best to follow google’s recommended app architecture and do everything “the right way™”. Hopefully it shows, even though a lot of the finer details may be somewhat janky homebrew. Anyway I hope you enjoy playing through it and if you have any questions, bug reports, or want to reach out about hiring me my email is right below! \n\n-Austin Green \n\naustinoguy51@gmail.com \n\ngithub link goes here</string>
